Hi Mill Community,

I'm a big fan of mill and been using it for my private toy projects since a while now. While I dont feel its yet managable by non-scala experienced users and nor stable enough (which is the reason I never introduced it in my work setting) I definitly hope that it will be soon.

Happy to get any feedback.
